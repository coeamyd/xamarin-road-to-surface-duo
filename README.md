## Prerequirements
- Windows 10 / macOS

## Other programms I used
- Microsoft [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) as information storage around the idea of the app
- Microsoft [Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) to clarify open question with the Dr. Windows team

- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html) to protoyp the UI

## Features
- Lists articles of [Dr. Windows](https://www.drwindows.de) 
- Good looking, hopefully (in my opinion)
- Utilizes Surface Duo features
- Utilizes App Center features

## UI concepts
I'm not a skilled user interface designer nor I have an eye for beauty, but the app should look mostly like the following concepts.

I used the free, but required an Adobe ID, application [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html) to create the protoyp views.

## Keep in mind
This app is purely build for having fun! All features have room for improvements or could be done more elegant.

## Contributing
Feel free to improve the quality of the code. It would be great to learn more from experienced C#, Xamarin and Azure developers.
